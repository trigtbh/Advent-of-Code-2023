# Mini-Writeups
## Day 1
- Honestly not too bad
- had the wrong input at the start which totally messed me up for a solid minute
- overlapping characters threw me off soooooooo much

## Day 2
- not bad at all
- AND BY THE WAY
- FIRST TIME EVER THAT I'VE GOTTEN IN THE TOP 100

## Day 3
- started by searching for numbers next to characters
- then switched *gears* to searching for characters next to numbers
- i think i got lucky that the numbers will only be adjacent to one gear
- but i think this solution would work regardless of that...? will need to check later

## Day 4
- I think the best measure of progress is finding problems
- and then seeing how quickly you're able to reason "ok this is why it isn't working, and this is how i could fix it"
- pt 2 could have seriously messed me up but i'm glad i was able to get it fixed really quickly

## Day 5
- For the record,
- ***I hate range splitting***
- never ever ever ever ever got it to work
- until tonight
- BUT WE FINALLY MADE IT TO 20% COMPLETION

## Day 6
- Brute force
- cough cough

## Day 7
- Honestly thought regex would have been faster
- choked HARD
- but still completed within the hour
- two years ago this would have taken me all the way to tomorrow
- BUT ITS FINALLY ONE WEEK DONE
