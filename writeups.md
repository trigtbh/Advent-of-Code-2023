# Mini-Writeups
## Day 1
- Honestly not too bad
- had the wrong input at the start which totally messed me up for a solid minute
- overlapping characters threw me off soooooooo much

## Day 2
- not bad at all
- AND BY THE WAY
- FIRST TIME EVER THAT I'VE GOTTEN IN THE TOP 100


## Day 3
- started by searching for numbers next to characters
- then switched *gears* to searching for characters next to numbers
- i think i got lucky that the numbers will only be adjacent to one gear
- but i think this solution would work regardless of that...? will need to check later
